Feature: Rollup rules
  In order to describe what happens when organizations or accounts are rolled up
  As financial personnel
  I want to create rules for rolling up the contents

  Scenario: Add rollup rules for organization
    # Given I have a monthly expense of telephone that is $50
    # And I have a monthly expense of cell_phone that is $75
    # And I have a monthly expense of rent that is $750
    # And I have a monthly expense of car_note that is $350
    # When I ask for my total monthly expenses
    # Then total of the monthly expenses should be $1225
